Project 3 for Game Algorithms Class

In order to properly run the game you'll need a local build of the project. Make sure to include all scenes when building.

For sanity's sake it's a good idea to update your git to ignore the crapton of files that shouldn't be committed. Add the following to the .git/info/exclude file:

*.csproj

*.cache

*.suo

*.sln

*.exe

/Assignment 3/Library

If you come across any other files/directories that should be excluded, make sure to update this reference.
